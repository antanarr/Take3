# Take3


This repository contains the Swift/SpriteKit implementation of **Orbit Flip Frenzy**, an iOS arcade title generated entirely from code. The goal of this README is to track follow-up tasks by discipline after reviewing the shipped code.

=======

## Programmatic asset coverage

All in-game visuals and audio cues are generated at runtime so the build has no external art dependencies. Key assets include:

- **Branding** – `AssetGenerator.makeLogoNode` and `makeAppIconImage` synthesize the logotype, share icon, and scalable rounded app icon imagery using the shared neon palette.
- **Interactive surfaces** – `makeButtonNode` and `makeBadgeNode` drive gradient CTA buttons and menu/game-over badges, while the new `makeHUDStatNode` powers in-game stat chips for score, multiplier, level, and active power-ups.
- **Gameplay elements** – `makePlayerNode`, `makeRingNode`, `makeObstacleNode`, and `makePowerUpNode` provide the glowing pod, concentric orbits, obstacles, and pulsing power-ups with aura emitters.
- **Particles & highlights** – `makeParticleTexture` feeds the trail, score burst, and near-miss emitters so all effects stay on brand.
- **Tutorial & feedback** – `makeGhostNode` introduces a stylized guidance orb for the opening obstacles, and `makeEventBanner` creates animated alerts for milestone events.

## Audio synthesis

`SoundEngine` already generates the six required effects (`gameStart`, `playerFlip`, `nearMiss`, `collision`, `milestone`, and `powerupCollect`) with AVAudioEngine. Each cue follows the timing and frequency ranges from the prompt so nothing needs to be sourced or licensed externally.

## Runtime integrations

- The menu and game-over scenes consume the generated branding, icons, and badges so every screen stays visually consistent.
- The gameplay HUD now uses generated stat widgets, the tutorial ghost, and particle textures for highlight feedback.
- Share sheets attach the generated app icon, and rewarded revive flows use the same button system for visual continuity.

## Follow-up notes & recommendations

- **Fonts** – The code references `Orbitron-Bold` and `SFProRounded` with system fallbacks. Ship-ready builds should include licensed font files or swap to bundled system fonts to avoid App Store rejections.
- **Asset export** – If you need static assets for marketing or an asset catalog, you can render them in a playground or a small command-line tool by calling the relevant generator methods (e.g. save `makeAppIconImage(size:)` outputs at 1024, 512, 180, etc.).
- **Audio validation** – Run the game on device or simulator with sound enabled to confirm the synthesized tones mix well at production volume. You can tweak envelopes or frequency sweeps in `SoundEngine` if mastering is required.
- **Additional polish** – Consider exporting a branded launch screen and App Store screenshots once UI copy is final. Those marketing assets are not produced automatically in this environment.

Everything else required by the README prompt is now produced in code and wired into the live scenes.


## Task Tracker

### Monetization

**Current implementation**

- StoreKit-backed `PurchaseManager` now consults remote config overrides for production product identifiers, handles purchase flows, verifies transactions, and exposes an iOS 15 restore UI that reconciles entitlements without duplicating consumables.
- `AdManager` tracks reward-ad load state, retries on failure, and either shows a production adapter (Google Mobile Ads when present) or a simulated rewarded video with cancellation/error analytics.
- Game over flow supports spending gems to continue, keeps the ad button stateful, and renders the player’s gem balance alongside revive options.
- The main menu renders live pricing fed by StoreKit/remote config, a Starter Pack banner driven by configurable cooldowns, hero-product/badge merchandising, gem totals, cosmetic purchases, and a restore button that surfaces the native flow.
- Analytics events are queued offline with disk-backed persistence, authenticated upload headers, configurable batch sizes, and enrichment for purchase, ad, gem, restore, and error events.

**Follow-up work**

1. Replace the simulated rewarded adapter with a real network SDK integration (e.g. AdMob/AppLovin), including dependency management, consent prompts, and mediation failover handling.
2. Stand up the real remote-config/telemetry backend, add auth rotation + exponential backoff, and expose tooling to edit hero products and merchandising copy.
3. Expand the cosmetic shop with previews, additional unlock types, and gem sinks tied to new content beyond the shield purchase path.
4. Implement integration testing around StoreKit restore flows, refund handling, and server-side entitlement reconciliation.
5. Build analytics dashboards that join purchase/ad/gem data for retention modeling and alert on upload failures surfaced by the reliable uploader.

**Risks & considerations**

- Ensure rewarded ads pause gameplay audio/haptics, gracefully handle dismissals, and avoid duplicate reward grants on failure retries.
- Verify receipt handling, entitlement persistence, and edge cases like refund/restoration across devices for StoreKit purchases.
- Localize storefront copy, gem pricing, and merch messaging and consider server-driven overrides before shipping internationally.
