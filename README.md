# Take3

## Programmatic asset coverage

All in-game visuals and audio cues are generated at runtime so the build has no external art dependencies. Key assets include:

- **Branding** – `AssetGenerator.makeLogoNode` and `makeAppIconImage` synthesize the logotype, share icon, and scalable rounded app icon imagery using the shared neon palette.
- **Interactive surfaces** – `makeButtonNode` and `makeBadgeNode` drive gradient CTA buttons and menu/game-over badges, while the new `makeHUDStatNode` powers in-game stat chips for score, multiplier, level, and active power-ups.
- **Gameplay elements** – `makePlayerNode`, `makeRingNode`, `makeObstacleNode`, and `makePowerUpNode` provide the glowing pod, concentric orbits, obstacles, and pulsing power-ups with aura emitters.
- **Particles & highlights** – `makeParticleTexture` feeds the trail, score burst, and near-miss emitters so all effects stay on brand.
- **Tutorial & feedback** – `makeGhostNode` introduces a stylized guidance orb for the opening obstacles, and `makeEventBanner` creates animated alerts for milestone events.

## Audio synthesis

`SoundEngine` already generates the six required effects (`gameStart`, `playerFlip`, `nearMiss`, `collision`, `milestone`, and `powerupCollect`) with AVAudioEngine. Each cue follows the timing and frequency ranges from the prompt so nothing needs to be sourced or licensed externally.

## Runtime integrations

- The menu and game-over scenes consume the generated branding, icons, and badges so every screen stays visually consistent.
- The gameplay HUD now uses generated stat widgets, the tutorial ghost, and particle textures for highlight feedback.
- Share sheets attach the generated app icon, and rewarded revive flows use the same button system for visual continuity.

## Follow-up notes & recommendations

- **Fonts** – The code references `Orbitron-Bold` and `SFProRounded` with system fallbacks. Ship-ready builds should include licensed font files or swap to bundled system fonts to avoid App Store rejections.
- **Asset export** – If you need static assets for marketing or an asset catalog, you can render them in a playground or a small command-line tool by calling the relevant generator methods (e.g. save `makeAppIconImage(size:)` outputs at 1024, 512, 180, etc.).
- **Audio validation** – Run the game on device or simulator with sound enabled to confirm the synthesized tones mix well at production volume. You can tweak envelopes or frequency sweeps in `SoundEngine` if mastering is required.
- **Additional polish** – Consider exporting a branded launch screen and App Store screenshots once UI copy is final. Those marketing assets are not produced automatically in this environment.

Everything else required by the README prompt is now produced in code and wired into the live scenes.
